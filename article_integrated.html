<em>An analysis of the housing affordability crisis and the policy tools designed to address it</em><br/>
<em>By Jing Yin and Merrila Liu | December 2024</em>
</div>

<div class="intro">
<p>While millions of American families struggle with severe housing cost burdens—spending more than half their income on rent—a complex system of federal, state, and local policies attempts to provide relief. But are these policy tools actually reaching the communities and households that need them most? This analysis examines both the geographic and demographic dimensions of the affordability crisis and the effectiveness of policy responses across different types of cities.</p>
</div>

     PART 1: THE CRISIS - Merrila's Section
     ============================================================================ -->
     <h2 id="the-crisis">Part 1: The Crisis: Where Housing Affordability Hurts Most</h2>

     <p> Affordability crisis does not look the same everywhere. In some communities, even very low rents make it difficult for low-wage workers. In others, rising prices are pushing cost burdens higher. Following Alan Mallach's ICMA framework, we distinguish between two overlapping and distinct patterns: <strong>systemic cost burden</strong> and <strong>strong-market cost burden</strong>.</p>
     
     <h3 id="systemic-vs-strong-market">Research Question 1: Systemic Cost Burden vs. Strong-Market Cost Burden</h3>
     
     <p><strong>Systemic cost burden</strong> describes places where very low-income households face high housing cost burdens even in markets that are not considered to be popular. By contrast, strong-market cost burden arises in high-demand metropolitan areas where incomes are higher on average but housing costs have risen even faster. </p>

     <h3 id="income-groups">Research Question 2: Burden and Coverage by City Type</h3>

    <p>Another way to view the crisis is to step back from individual cities and compare <em>types</em> of markets. When we group our eight metros into strong-market, legacy, and mixed-market categories, we can see both how much of the country’s severe cost burden each type carries and how much subsidy coverage it has relative to that burden.</p>

Dashed reference lines mark the overall average burden share and average coverage level, making it easy to see which city types carry a disproportionate share of need and which fall below average on subsidy coverage.</p>

       <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> COVID-19 magnified both <em>systemic</em> and <em>strong-market</em> cost burdens. Legacy and weaker-market cities saw affordability erode as national prices rose from unusually low baselines, while high-cost metros experienced some of the largest jumps in housing values. The result is a post-pandemic landscape in which renters at all income levels—especially the lowest-income households—face deeper and more widespread affordability pressures than in the previous decade.</p>

     PART 2: THE POLICY RESPONSE - Your Section (Already Complete)
     ============================================================================ -->
<h2 id="the-policy-toolkit">Part 2: The Policy Response: Tools and Coverage</h2>

<p>The United States has developed a decentralized, multi-layered system of affordable housing policies. As outlined in the Penn IUR policy brief, this system includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Housing:</strong> Government-owned and managed housing units, though the stock has been declining for decades</li>
  <li><strong>Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8):</strong> The largest program, providing rental assistance to eligible households</li>
  <li><strong>Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC):</strong> Tax incentives that have become the primary tool for new affordable housing construction</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusionary Zoning (IZ):</strong> Local requirements that new developments include affordable units</li>
  <li><strong>Project-Based Section 8:</strong> Subsidies tied to specific properties rather than households</li>
  <li><strong>Tax Abatement Programs:</strong> Property tax reductions to incentivize affordable housing development</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these tools has different strengths, limitations, and geographic distributions. Understanding how they work together—or fail to—is essential to addressing the affordability crisis.</p>

<h3 id="research-question-1">Research Question 1: Are Subsidized Units Reaching the Most Burdened Communities?</h3>

<p>Our first analysis examines whether affordable housing programs are geographically aligned with the communities experiencing the most severe cost burdens. This is a critical question because, as the Penn IUR brief notes, the U.S. housing system is largely decentralized and driven by private sector actions—even at the affordable end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>We analyzed eight major metropolitan areas representing different market types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strong-market cities:</strong> New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy cities:</strong> Detroit, Cleveland</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed-market cities:</strong> Chicago, Philadelphia</li>
</ul>

<p>For each city, we calculated the number of severely cost-burdened renters and compared it to the total supply of subsidized units (including public housing, vouchers, LIHTC units, and project-based Section 8). The results reveal significant disparities.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> In cities with the highest numbers of severely cost-burdened renters, the ratio of subsidized units to need is often lowest. This suggests that the policy tools are not effectively targeting the communities experiencing the most severe affordability challenges.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3 id="research-question-2">Research Question 2: Do Different Cities Rely on Different Policy Mixes?</h3>

<p>Our second analysis explores whether different types of cities employ different combinations of policy tools. This question is important because, as the Penn IUR brief explains, the affordable housing system is a "toolkit" where different programs serve different functions and have different strengths.</p>

<div class="figure-container">
<figure>
<iframe src="visualizations/policy_mix_altair.html" width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Policy Mix Comparison</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="figure-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The composition of affordable housing policy tools across different cities, shown as percentages of total subsidized units. This visualization reveals distinct policy strategies: strong-market cities (like New York and San Francisco) rely more heavily on LIHTC and inclusionary zoning, while legacy cities (like Detroit and Cleveland) depend more on public housing and vouchers. <em>Data source: Analysis of policy mix data by city type.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The data reveals clear patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strong-market cities</strong> (New York, San Francisco, Boston) show a greater reliance on LIHTC (around 45% of units) and inclusionary zoning programs. This makes sense given that these cities have active real estate markets where tax credits and zoning requirements can leverage private development.</li>
  <li><strong>Legacy cities</strong> (Detroit, Cleveland) rely more heavily on public housing (around 40%) and vouchers (around 35%). These cities have older public housing stock and face different market conditions that make LIHTC less attractive to developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed-market cities</strong> (Chicago, Philadelphia) show a more balanced approach, with roughly equal proportions of different tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="research-question-3">Research Question 3: Are We Losing Affordable Units Faster Than We're Creating Them?</h3>

<p>Our third analysis addresses a critical but often overlooked challenge: the expiration of affordability restrictions. As the Penn IUR brief notes, "Most privately owned affordable housing units have provisions that allow the subsidies to sunset after a specified period."</p>

<div class="figure-container">
<figure>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Projected expiration of affordable housing units over the next 20 years (2025-2045), by city. This timeline shows the cumulative risk of losing affordable units as LIHTC and Section 8 contracts expire. The accelerating trend in later years reflects the large number of units built during the LIHTC program's expansion in the 1990s and 2000s. <em>Data source: Analysis of LIHTC and Section 8 contract expiration data.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> The cities with the highest numbers of expiring units often overlap with cities that have the highest numbers of severely cost-burdened renters. This creates a "double burden" where communities already struggling with affordability face the additional challenge of losing existing affordable units.</p>

     PART 3: THE GAP - Joint Section (Completed)
     ============================================================================ -->
     <h2 id="the-gap">Part 3: The Gap Between Problem and Solution</h2>

     <p>The analyses in Parts 1 and 2 reveal a fundamental disconnect: the communities and households experiencing the most severe housing affordability challenges are not always the ones receiving the most support from policy tools. Even within our eight study cities, the relationship between need, policy capacity, and actual program coverage is uneven. This section explains why this gap exists—and what it means for designing effective housing policy.</p>
     
     
     <h3 id="zoning-reform-limitations">Why Zoning Reform Alone Is Not Enough</h3>
     
     <p>Zoning reform is often portrayed as a universal, high-leverage solution to housing affordability. But the evidence—both nationally and in our study cities—shows that zoning reform is structurally limited in what it can deliver, especially for the lowest-income households.</p>
     
     <p>Even in ambitious cases, such as Minneapolis’s elimination of single-family zoning, production effects have been modest. As the ICMA analysis notes, Minneapolis rezoned roughly 70 percent of its land, yet only around 100 new units were added under the reform after two and a half years. The reason is not political resistance or poor implementation—it is basic urban economics.</p>
     
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Most rezoned parcels are already built out.</strong> Older housing stock often sits on small lots with low redevelopment value; replacing it requires up-front costs that far exceed rents achievable in the market.</li>
     
       <li><strong>New construction is inherently expensive.</strong> Even in legacy cities with low land values, new infill housing costs far more than what very low-income renters can pay, meaning market-rate production cannot address systemic cost burden.</li>
     
       <li><strong>Zoning reform works slowly and unevenly.</strong> It may unlock future capacity, but it does little for households currently spending 50 percent or more of their income on rent.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <blockquote>
       <p>As Mallach writes, “Zoning reform can remove barriers, but it cannot create economic conditions that make low-cost housing financially feasible in the private market.”</p>
     </blockquote>
     
     
     <h3 id="geographic-misalignment">Geographic Misalignment: Policy Tools vs. Need</h3>
     
     <p>Our coverage analysis shows that the highest-need cities do not consistently have the highest levels of subsidy coverage. Strong-market metros in our sample contain the largest <em>numbers</em> of severely burdened renters, yet they often have lower ratios of subsidized units to need because demand far outpaces available resources. Legacy cities, by contrast, may have a higher coverage ratio but still face deep, structural affordability problems tied to low wages rather than land scarcity.</p>
     
     <p>This misalignment matters because the <em>type</em> of burden differs across geographies:</p>
     
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Systemic cost burden</strong> is driven by wages that are too low to afford even low-cost housing.</li>
       <li><strong>Strong-market cost burden</strong> is driven by high housing prices and insufficient supply.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>But the distribution of vouchers, LIHTC units, and local subsidies does not consistently match these patterns. As a result:</p>
     
     <ul>
       <li>Strong-market cities do not have enough subsidized units to keep pace with escalating prices.</li>
       <li>Legacy cities lack deep-subsidy tools to help very low-income renters whose wages fall far below what the private market can serve.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Both contexts face shortages, but the nature of the shortage—and thus the required intervention—is different.</p>
     
     
     <h3 id="systemic-solutions">Systemic Problems Require Systemic Solutions</h3>
     
     <p>Bridging the affordability gap requires matching policy tools to the <em>type</em> of burden they are meant to address. The findings from Parts 1 and 2 combine to show that:</p>
     
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Systemic cost burden cannot be solved through supply-side tools alone.</strong> When incomes are too low to afford even the lowest-cost housing, only direct assistance—housing vouchers, tenant-based allowances, or guaranteed minimum housing benefits—can close the gap.</li>
     
       <li><strong>Strong-market burden is partly a supply problem.</strong> In these markets, zoning reform, missing-middle infill, and streamlined approvals can help—but only when paired with targeted tools like project-based subsidies, inclusionary zoning, and capital funding that lower the cost of delivering affordable units.</li>
     
       <li><strong>Coverage matters as much as production.</strong> Even a perfectly designed tool cannot succeed if the city only has enough resources to reach 5–10 percent of cost-burdened renters.</li>
     
       <li><strong>A single tool cannot serve all income groups.</strong> The deepest subsidies must be reserved for the lowest-income renters, while moderate-income households in high-cost markets benefit more from production, land use reform, and shared-equity or starter-home programs.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>In short, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to the affordability crisis because the crisis itself is not one-size-fits-all. A system that treats all cities as if they have the same problem will inevitably misallocate resources—and leave many households behind.</p>
     
     <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The affordability crisis is really two crises—one rooted in low incomes, the other in high housing costs. Policies aimed at production cannot solve systemic cost burden, and policies aimed at financial assistance cannot build new supply in strong-market metros. Effective solutions require aligning each tool with the specific type of burden it is designed to address, and delivering those tools where they are most needed.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: A System in Need of Alignment</h2>
    
    <p>Across geographies, policy tools, and time horizons, a clear pattern emerges: the communities experiencing the most severe housing affordability challenges are not always the ones receiving the most support. This misalignment operates at multiple levels:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Geographic:</strong> High-need communities do not consistently receive proportional resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Policy mix:</strong> Cities apply different combinations of tools, but those mixes do not always match local housing market conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal:</strong> Expiring affordability restrictions threaten to erase gains even where production is occurring.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem type:</strong> Tools designed for strong-market burden often fail to address systemic burden—and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The ICMA analysis and Penn IUR brief both emphasize that housing affordability cannot be solved with a single intervention. Systemic cost burden requires deep, ongoing assistance for the lowest-income families, while strong-market burden demands supply expansion and land-use reform paired with affordability requirements. Most importantly, policy tools must be strategically deployed—matched to both the <em>market context</em> and the <em>households</em> they are intended to serve.</p>
    
    <p>America's affordable housing system is complex and decentralized. But complexity is not destiny. With better data, clearer alignment between need and resources, and a commitment to matching solutions to problems, we can begin to close the gap between where affordability challenges are concentrated and where policy capacity is directed.</p>
